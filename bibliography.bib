abstract = {Despite application of cryogen spray (CS) precooling, customary treatment of port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks with a single laser pulse does not result in complete lesion blanching for a majority of patients. One obvious reason is nonselective absorption by epidermal melanin, which limits the maximal safe radiant exposure. Another possible reason for treatment failure is screening of laser light within large PWS vessels, which prevents uniform heating of the entire vessel lumen. Our aim is to identify the parameters of sequential CS cooling and laser irradiation that will allow optimal photocoagulation of various PWS blood vessels with minimal risk of epidermal thermal damage.},

abstract = {Cognitive therapists suggest panic disorder to result from 'catastrophic' misinterpretation of bodily sensations. The patient suffering from panic disorder consistently misinterprets normal anxiety responses, such as racing heart, breathlessness or dizziness, as indicating impending disaster. Cognitive therapists, who challenge the traditional view of anxiety as 'free-floating' and irrational, argue that the patient's anxiety is an understandable response to their misinterpretations, and advocate a treatment method based on the patient's specific cognitive make-up and on the principle of collaborative empiricism. The patient is gently guided to identify and challenge idiosyncratic cognitions, and to consider alternative interpretations of danger signs. The article provides an outline of the treatment method and its empirical support.},

Applications are discussed in °uid dynamics, nonlinear solid mechanics and coupled problems describing °uid-structure interaction. The need for an adequate mesh update strategy is underlined and various automatic mesh displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh adaptation techniques aiming at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible °ow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems. This includes the treatment of convective terms in the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy, as well as a discussion of stress update procedures for materials with history-dependent constitutive behaviour.},

They are often represented by a network of fictitious lineal springs that can become unreliable when the fluid mesh undergoes large displacements and/or deformations. In this paper, we propose to control the arbitrary motion of two-dimensional dynamic unstructured fluid grids with additional torsional springs. We show that such springs can be designed to prohibit the interpenetration of neighboring triangles, and therefore to provide the method of spring analogy with the robustness needed for enlarging its range of applications. We illustrate our new dynamic mesh motion algorithm with several examples that highlight its advantages in terms of robustness, quality, and performance.},

The key components of the proposed method include: (a) the definition of a discrete surrogate material interface, (b) the computation of a reliable approximation of the fluid state vector on each side of a discrete material interface via the construction and solution of a local, exact, two-phase Riemann problem, (c) the algebraic solution of this auxiliary problem when the equation of state allows it, and (d) the solution of this two-phase Riemann problem using sparse grid tabulations otherwise.

abstract = {Embedded Boundary Methods (EBMs) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are usually constructed in the Eulerian setting. They are particularly attractive for complex Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems characterized by large structural motions and deformations. They are also critical for flow problems with topological changes and FSI problems with cracking. For all of these problems, the alternative Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods are often unfeasible because of the issue of mesh crossovers. However for viscous flows, Eulerian EBMs for CFD do not track the boundary layers around dynamic rigid or flexible bodies. Consequently, the application of these methods to viscous FSI problems requires either a high mesh resolution in a large part of the computational fluid domain, or adaptive mesh refinement. Unfortunately, the first option is computationally inefficient, and the second one is labor intensive. For these reasons, an alternative approach is proposed in this paper for maintaining all moving boundary layers resolved during the simulation of a turbulent FSI problem using an EBM for CFD. In this approach, which is simple and computationally reasonable, the underlying non-body-fitted mesh is rigidly translated and/or rotated in order to track the rigid component of the motion of the dynamic obstacle. Then, the flow computations away from the embedded surface are performed using the ALE framework, and the wall boundary conditions are treated by the chosen Eulerian EBM for CFD. Hence, the solution of the boundary layer tracking problem proposed in this paper can be described as an ALE implementation of a given EBM for CFD. Its basic features are illustrated with the Large Eddy Simulation using a non-body-fitted mesh of a turbulent flow past an airfoil in heaving motion. Its strong potential for the solution of challenging FSI problems at reasonable computational costs is also demonstrated with the simulation of turbulent flows past a family of highly flexible flapping wings. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This book contains an introduction to hyperbolic partial differential equations and a powerful class of numerical methods for approximating their solution, including both linear problems and nonlinear conservation laws. These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

Among the major contributions are an implicit time stepping method for embedded boundaries with highly nonlinear physical phenomena, which is shown to be up to 40x faster than the corresponding explicit time stepping scheme. Also, a multigrid method for the FIVER embedded boundary method is presented, which enables the solution of steady flow problems nearly 12x faster than a standard Newton-Krylov time stepping scheme. Then a second order extension of FIVER is introduced for multi-fluid and fluid-structure interaction problems. Finally, the stability and accuracy properties of this extension are analyzed.},

abstract = {A family of compressible multi-phase fluid and fluid-structure interaction problems for which implicit schemes are preferable over explicit counterparts is identified. Using as a backdrop a finite volume method based on exact two-phase Riemann problems that has proven to be robust for multi-phase flows with strong contact discontinuities and highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problems, an implicit computational framework for the solution of such problems is presented. General issues that arise in the context of second- and higher-order time-discretizations of multi-material problems by multi-step schemes are highlighted, and solutions to these issues are presented in the form of redesigned implicit time-integrators. The proposed implicit computational framework is illustrated with the solution of an air-water shock tube problem, a realistic compressible multi-phase fluid problem, and a highly nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem associated with the underwater implosion of a cylindrical shell. In all cases, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed implicit computational framework are demonstrated, and its superior computational performance is highlighted.},

@book{Moukalled2016,
abstract = {This chapter is devoted to a number of “small” numerical details that may have “big” effects on the solution behavior. First the treatment of the source term in the general case when it is solution dependent (i.e., when Q{\textless}sup{\textgreater}f{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=Q{\textless}sup{\textgreater}f{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}(f)) is examined. The source is linearized in terms of the dependent variable and split into two parts, one treated explicitly and the second treated implicitly. This is followed by a discussion of explicit and implicit techniques for under-relaxing the algebraic equations. Several implicit under-relaxing approaches are presented, starting with the well known implicit under relaxation method of Patankar (Numerical heat transfer and fluid flow, 1980) [1], the E-factor method of van Doormaal and Raithby (Numerical Heat Transfer 7:147–163, 1984) [2], and the false transient approach of Mallinson and de Vahl Davis (Journal of Computational Physics 12 (4):435–461, 1973) [3]. Then the residual form of the discretized algebraic equation is introduced. The chapter ends with the presentation of convergence indicators used to evaluate the solution convergence status.},

@article{Peskin1972,
abstract = {The subject of this paper is the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a region containing immersed boundaries which move with the fluid and exert forces on the fluid. An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the $\delta$ function is introduced. Because the boundary forces are of order h-1, and because they are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method which takes into account the displacements that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

abstract = {Several numerical schemes for the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws are based on exploiting the information obtained by considering a sequence of Riemann problems. It is argued that in existing schemes much of this information is degraded, and that only certain features of the exact solution are worth striving for. It is shown that these features can be obtained by constructing a matrix with a certain “Property U.” Matrices having this property are exhibited for the equations of steady and unsteady gasdynamics. In order to construct thems it is found helpful to introduce “parameter vectors” which notably simplify the structure of the conservation laws.},

The purpose of the paper is to present the numerical results of a comparative study of eleven mathematical program- ming codes which represent typicM realizations of the mathemat- ical methods mentioned. They are implemented in the structural optimization system MBB-LAGRANGE, which proceeds from a typical finite element analysis. The comparative results are ob- tained from a collection of 79 test problems. The majority of them are academic test cases, the others possess some practical real life background. Optimization is performed with respect to sizing of trusses and beams, wall thicknesses, etc., subject to stress, dis- placement, and many other constraints. Numerical comparison is based on reliability and efficiency measured by calculation time an{\~{}}t number of analyses needed to reach a certain accuracy level.},

abstract = {A method is presented for computing sensitivity derivatives with respect to independent (input) variables for complex, internally coupled systems, while avoiding the cost and inaccuracy of finite differencing performed on the entire system analysis. The method entails two alternative algorithms: the first is based on the classical implicit function theorem formulated on residuals of governing equations, and the second develops the system sensitivity equations in a new form using the partial (local) sensitivity derivatives of the output with respect to the input for each part of the system. A few application examples are presented to illustrate the discussion. The method has potential to answer the "what if" questions by presenting engineers with sensitivity information on design tradeoffs to guide human judgment and formal optimization. In addition, the method is compatible with the modern technology of distributed computing as well as traditional division of design tasks among groups of specialists in the design process. The capability to quantify the effects of proposed design changes may provide the basis for a mathematical model of design.},

@article{VanLeer1979,
abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series "Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.". ?? 1979.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},
