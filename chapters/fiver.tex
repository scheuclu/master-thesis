\section{Fiver}\label{sec:fiver}

It was already outlined in Section REF, that using an Eulerian approach int the context of an thermoelastic simulations leads to a so-called embedded formulation, where the interface of the structure mesh no longer coincides with the fluid mesh. This was appealing, since it allowed for the usage of fixed meshes and an Eulerian formulation, on the other hand as  explained in Section REF, an error of the order $\order(\frac{h}{2})$ is introduced.\\

A possible solution to this problem is the \ac{FIVER} method.


\subsection{Level-set method}
Since the interface in an embedded stimulation typically moves, an appropriate interface tracking approach is required.\\
For \ac{FIVER}, the popular level set method was chosen.
