abstract = {Summary: The finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI) and Neumann-Neumann families of algorithms are among the best known and most severely tested domain decomposition methods for elliptic partial differential equations. They are iterative substructuring methods and have many algorithmic components in common, but there are also differences. The purpose of this paper is to further unify the theory for these two families of methods and to introduce a new family of FETI algorithms. Bounds on the rate of convergence, which are uniform with respect to the coefficients of a family of elliptic problems with heterogeneous coefficients, are established for these new algorithms. The theory for a variant of the Neumann-Neumann algorithm is also redeveloped stressing similarities to that for the FETI methods.},

abstract = {Explicit codes are often used to simulate the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale structural systems, even for low frequency response, because the storage and CPU requirements entailed by the repeated factorizations traditionally found in implicit codes rapidly overwhelm the available computing resources. With the advent of parallel processing, this trend is accelerating because explicit schemes are also easier to parallelize than implicit ones. However, the time step restriction imposed by the Courant stability condition on all explicit schemes cannot yet -- and perhaps will never -- be offset by the speed of parallel hardware. Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient and robust alternatives to direct methods that are also amenable to massively parallel processing because implicit codes using unconditionally stable time-integration algorithms are computationally more efficient when simulating low-frequency dynamics. Here we present a domain decomposition method for implicit schemes that requires significantly less storage than factorization algorithms, that is several times faster than other popular direct and iterative methods, that can be easily implemented on both shared and local memory parallel processors, and that is both computationally and communication-wise efficient. The proposed transient domain decomposition method is an extension of the method of Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) developed by Farhat and Roux for the solution of static problems. Serial and parallel performance results on the CRAY Y-MP/8 and the iPSC-860/128 systems are reported and analyzed for realistic structural dynamics problems. These results establish the superiority of the FETI method over both the serial/parallel conjugate gradient algorithm with diagonal scaling and the serial/parallel direct method, and contrast the computational power of the iPSC-860/128 parallel processor with that of the CRAY Y-MP/8 system.},

abstract = {Two domain decomposition methods with Lagrange multipliers for solving iteratively quadratic programming problems with inequality constraints are presented. These methods are based on the FETI and FETI-DP substructuring algorithms. In the case of linear constraints, they do not perform any Newton-like iteration. Instead, they solve a constrained problem by an active set strategy and a generalized conjugate gradient based descent method equipped with controls to guarantee convergence monotonicity. Both methods possess the desirable feature of minimizing numerical oscillations during the iterative solution process. Performance results and comparisons are reported for several numerical simulations that suggest that both methods are numerically scalable with respect to both the problem size and the number of subdomains. Their parallel scalability is also illustrated on a Linux cluster for a complex 1.4 million degree of freedom multibody problem with frictionless contact and nonconforming discrete interfaces. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We describe the design and implementation of the parallel mesh structures within an adaptive framework. The most fundamental concept is that of a hierarchical partition model used to distribute finite element meshes and associated data on a parallel computer. The hierarchical model represents heterogeneous processor and network speeds, and may be used to represent processes in any parallel computing environment, including an SMP, a distributed-memory computer, a network of workstations, or some combination of these. Using this model to segment the computation into chunks which can fit into cache memory provides a potential efficiency gain from an increased cache hit rate, even in a single processor environment. The information about different processor speeds, memory sizes, and the corresponding interconnection network can be useful in a dynamic load balancing algorithm which seeks to achieve a good balance with minimal interprocessor communication penalties when a slow interconnection network is involved.},

The solution method combines finite element approximations, time discretization by operators splitting and conjugate gradient algorithms for the solution of the linearly constrained quadratic minimization problems coming from the splitting method. We conclude this article by the presentation of numerical results concerning the simulation of an incompressible viscous flow around a NACA0012 airfoil with a fixed center, but free to rotate, then the sedimentation of circular cylinders in 2-D channels, and finally the sedimentation of spherical balls in cylinders with square cross-sections.

abstract = {This article describes the use of fluid flow simulation on parallel computing platforms to solve design problems in the automotive industry. The fluid flow formulation in the SpectrumTM solver, which is used for these simulations, is described. The finite element treatment of fluid flow in this work is based on the Galerkin-Least-Squares (GLS) method with discontinuity capturing operators. The Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method is utilized to account for deformable fluid domains. Automatically generated tetrahedral grids are used to ease and expedite the analysis process. The multiphysics architecture used in this work lends itself naturally to high-performance parallel computing. By taking advantage of automatic mesh generation and parallel computing, dramatic reduction in turnaround time for flow analysis is achieved. Several applications are presented which demonstrate the utility and accuracy of finite element solutions in automotive engineering problems and highlight the scalability of the software.},

@article{Brown2000,
abstract = {We describe a general strategy we have found effective for parallelizing solid mechanics simulations. Such simulations often have several computationally intensive parts, including finite element integration, detection of material contacts, and particle interaction if smoothed particle hydrodynamics is used to model highly deforming materials. The need to balance all of these computations simultaneously is a difficult challenge that has kept many commercial and government codes from being used effectively on parallel supercomputers with hundreds or thousands of processors. Our strategy is to load-balance each of the significant computations independently with whatever balancing technique is most appropriate. The chief benefit is that each computation can be scalably parallelized. The drawback is the data exchange between processors and extra coding that must be written to maintain multiple decompositions in a single code. We discuss these trade-offs and give performance results showing this strategy has led to a parallel implementation of a widely used solid mechanics code that can now be run efficiently on thousands of processors of the Pentium-based Sandia/Intel TFLOPS machine. We illustrate with several examples the kinds of high-resolution, million-element models that can now be simulated routinely. We also look to the future and discuss what possibilities this new capability promises, as well as the new set of challenges it poses in material models, computational techniques, and computing infrastructure.},

@article{Carre2000,
abstract = {The interest in unstructured meshes for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications appears to be increasingly important in the industrial community. Industrial applications require the numerical simulation of complex flows (i.e. the underlying flows exhibit localized high variations of physical quantities) around or within complex geometries. Unstructured meshes are particularly well suited to these kinds of simulation due to their ability in accurately discretizing complex computational domains and, to their flexibility in dynamically refining and derefining, or deforming, in order to match the underlying flow features. Concerning flow solvers, the main question appears to be the lack of efficiency demonstrated by unstructured mesh solvers compared to structured ones. Many efficient methods developed in the structured context are not easily extensible to unstructured meshes and much research work has yet to be done in this direction. During the last ten years, several such works have demonstrated that multigrid principles can yield robust and efficient unstructured mesh solvers (see for example Lallemand et al., Koobus et al., Carre, Mavriplis et al). In this paper, we describe ongoing research activities at Inria Sophia Antipolis aiming at the construction of efficient and robust unstructured multigrid solvers for complex two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) flow simulations. Both academic and industrial aspects are considered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we present the second generation of these methods that operate more efficiently on large numbers of subdomains, offer greater robustness, better performance, and more flexibility for implementation on a wider variety of computational platforms. We also report on the application and performance of these methods for the solution of geometrically non-linear structural analysis problems. We discuss key aspects of their implementation on shared and distributed memory parallel processors, benchmark them against optimized direct sparse solvers, and highlight their potential with the solution of large-scale structural mechanics problems with several million degrees of freedom.},

The estimation can be performed both in the course of the iterations and after their termination. The importance of such techniques follows from the non-existence of some reasonable a priori error estimate for very ill-conditioned linear systems when sufficient information about the right-hand side vector is lacking. Hence, some a posteriori estimates are required, which make it possible to verify the quality of the solution obtained for a prescribed light-hand side. The performance of the considered error control procedures is demonstrated using real-world large-scale linens systems arising in computational mechanics.

It is shown that this method is a special case of a very general method which als includes Haussian elimination.

abstract = {Because of the exponential increase of computational resource requirement for numerical field simulations of more and more complex physical phenomena and more and more complex large problems in science and engineering practice, parallel processing appears to be an essential tool to handle the resulting large-scale numerical problems. One way of parallelization of sequential (singleprocessor) finite element simulations is the use of domain decomposition methods. Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for parallel solution of linear systems of equations are based on the partitioning of the analyzed domain into sub-domains which are calculated in parallel while doing appropriate data exchange between those sub-domains. In this case, the non-overlapping domain decomposition method is the Lagrange multiplier based Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) method. This paper describes one direct solver and two parallel solution algorithms of FETI method. Finally, comparative numerical tests demonstrate the differences in the parallel running performance of the solvers of FETI method. We use a single-phase transformer and a three-phase induction motor as twodimensional static magnetic field test problems to compare the solvers.},

@article{Farhat1991,
abstract = {A novel domain decomposition approach for the parallel finite element solution of equilibrium equations is presented. The spatial domain is partitioned into a set of totally disconnected subdomains, each assigned to an individual processor. Lagrange multipliers are introduced to enforce compatibility at the interface nodes. In the static case, each floating subdomain induces a local singularity that is resolved in two phases. First, the rigid body modes are eliminated in parallel from each local problem and a direct scheme is applied concurrently to all subdomains in order to recover each partial local solution. Next, the contributions of these modes are related to the Lagrange multipliers through an orthogonality condition. A parallel conjugate projected gradient algorithm is developed for the solution of the coupled system of local rigid modes components and Lagrange multipliers, which completes the solution of the problem. When implemented on local memory multiprocessors, this proposed method of tearing and interconnecting requires less interprocessor communications than the classical method of substructuring. It is also suitable for parallel/vector computers with shared memory. Moreover, unlike parallel direct solvers, it exhibits a degree of parallelism that is not limited by the bandwidth of the finite element system of equations.},

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

abstract = {The FETI algorithms are a family of numerically scalable substructuring methods with Lagrange multipliers that have been designed for solving iteratively large-scale systems of equations arising from the finite element discretization of structural engineering, solid mechanics, and structural dynamics problems. In this paper, we present a unified framework that simplifies the interpretation of several of the previously presented FETI concepts. This framework has enabled the improvement of the robustness and performance of the transient FETI method, and the design of a new family of coarse operators for iterative substructuring algorithms with Lagrange multipliers. We report on both of these new developments, discuss their impact on the iterative solution of large-scale finite element systems of equations by the FETI method, and illustrate them with a few static and dynamic structural analyses on an IBM SP2 parallel processor.},

This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},
