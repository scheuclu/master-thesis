\section*{Abstract}
This is the most often read section. It will determine if someone actually bothers to read more
of what you've written. Only write this section after you have completed your
report. The abstract consist of only one paragraph, mostly limited
to 200-300 words. Literally, a summary of your work. Write a sentence
or two about each of the main sections of your report, as discussed in this section. When
summarizing results, make the reader aware of the most important results (including numbers when applicable)
and important conclusions or questions that follow from these.
